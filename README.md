This week our focus was to re-create the about page on the Travel-Fly prototype. We also began to learn how to recognize content that remains consistent on all pages and setting those items up. We also notices what needed to change throughout different pages and how. Our page, much like last week, had to be responsive. We had to use media queries and percentages in order to make it align with the browser decreasing or increasing.
